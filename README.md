# HR-Employee-Distribution-Report

## Introduction

This project provides valuable insights into the distribution of employees in an organization, which can be crucial for HR management and strategic planning.

## Project overview

Here in this project, I have been given a raw data of Human Resources that contains all the information about the employee like first name, last name, birthdate, race, gender, department, job title, location, hiring date, termination date, employee city and employee state. My job in this project is to clean the raw data , then find the useful insights from the data and then display all those useful insights in the form of Visualizations.

 -The races with the greatest numberÂ is white, while American Indian and Native Hawaiian are the least prevalent.
   
 - The youngest employee is 21 years old and the oldest is 58 years old
   
 - 5 age groups were created (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64). A large number of employees were between 35-44 followed by 25-34 while the smallest group was 55-64.

## Limitations

- During the searching process, records with negative ages were eliminated, totaling 967 records. The age range used was 18 years old and up.
- A few termdates (1599 records) were excluded from the analysis because they were too far in the future. Dates that were less than or equal to the present date were the only terms that were used.
